Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning (For Females Only)  This project is a Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction System developed using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. The dataset contains records of female patients only, so the model is designed specifically for females.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights

Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€“ finds the best hyperplane to separate diabetic (1) and non-diabetic (0).
Scaler: StandardScaler â€“ normalizes the features for better SVM performance.
Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.
Frontend: Streamlit app for user-friendly input and predictions.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Data preprocessing with StandardScaler.
Model training using SVM (linear kernel).
Train-Test split with stratification to balance outcomes.
Streamlit interface for entering health parameters like pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, BMI, and age.
Predicts whether the female patient is Diabetic (1) or Non-Diabetic (0).
